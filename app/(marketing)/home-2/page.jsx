                    description="Recreational Water Illness (RWI) is a term for infections caused by germs spread by swimming in contaminated water. Even well-treated pools can have RWIs, due to micro-organisms and byproducts from the interaction of chlorine with bather-introduced substances like sweat, body oils, and lotions. These contaminants reduce the chlorine's effectiveness and can create a shield on surfaces where bacteria hide and multiply. It's essential to maintain proper pool hygiene to protect against RWIs."
